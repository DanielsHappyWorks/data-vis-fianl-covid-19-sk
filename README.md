# data-vis-fianl-covid-19-sk
For the country allocated to you do the following:
• Use websites such as the ECDC or WHO to source relevant temporal and
geospatial data relating to the Covid-19 pandemic.
• Write a report detailing the spread of the infection over time for the allocated
country, its position in its continent, and its position globally. This “position” should
consider:
? absolutes such as death rates, infecftion rates, recovery rates, etc.
? relatives such as whether our conuntry is ahead or behind the curve with respect
to its neighbours and globally, whether the country has “flattened the curve”, etc.
• Your report should contain justifications for your visualisation(s) and should clearly
state what conclusions you have drawn.
• Your report should try to make predictions about the length of the pandemic based
on the available evidence from the visualisations.

The allocated catec country is South Korea
